:::info Note
Due to the nature of the project, there was a bias towards iOS while developing and testing this library. Though Android is supported, some features (like SFSymbols) can't be implemented.
:::

## Add the package

```console
yarn add swiftui-react-native
```

## Add the dependencies

```console
yarn add react-native-sfsymbols
```

:::info Dependencies
`react-native-sfsymbols` requires extra steps to set up. Complete them [here](https://github.com/birkir/react-native-sfsymbols). This library is only supported on iOS due to [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/).

## Go build!

You should be all set now. Go build something awesome!
